""" batched, sqlite3 optimised and multi threaded version.

This version builds from sqlite3_opt_batched.py, but this one is multithreaded and probabaly the complex variant of all python ones.

We have a queue, spawn a single writer thread which consumes from queue and writes to SQLite. Then we spawn few more producer threads
which generate the data, push to queue.
